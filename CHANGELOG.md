All notable changes to the OpenSubtitles MCP Server project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed double HTTP response sending causing JSON parsing errors in n8n
- Added `res.headersSent` guard to prevent duplicate response transmission
- Fixed "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON" error in n8n MCP client
- Enhanced User-Agent detection for n8n clients (node, n8n, langchain, mcpClientTool)

### Added
- Debug endpoint `/debug` for testing JSON response format
- Force JSON endpoint `/json` for guaranteed plain JSON responses
- Enhanced logging for response format debugging
- Comprehensive n8n client compatibility detection

### Technical Details
- Double response issue: Server was sending plain JSON response + chunked response
- Solution: Added headersSent check to prevent second response
- All n8n clients now receive proper plain JSON without parsing errors

## [1.4.8_n8n_json_fix] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- Enhanced n8n client detection patterns
- Force JSON endpoint for debugging
- Improved User-Agent pattern matching

## [1.4.7] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- Documentation updates for n8n integration
- Comprehensive CHANGELOG documentation

## [1.4.6_n8n_plain_json] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- Native n8n MCP client compatibility with adaptive response format
- Plain JSON responses for n8n clients to fix chunked encoding parsing issues
- Tools included directly in initialize response for n8n compatibility
- Enhanced debug logging for MCP client detection and response formatting
- User-Agent based client detection (n8n uses "node" User-Agent)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed empty tools list in n8n MCP client integration
- n8n now receives all 3 tools (search_subtitles, download_subtitle, calculate_file_hash) properly
- Chunked HTTP response encoding issues with n8n client parsing
- Tools now available in both `capabilities.tools.available` and `result.tools` arrays

### Changed
- Adaptive HTTP response format: plain JSON for n8n, chunked for other clients
- Enhanced initialize response with tools for immediate availability
- Updated capabilities structure to include tool names in `available` array
- Improved error handling and client compatibility detection

### Technical Details
- Added `streamResponse()` function with client detection
- n8n clients (User-Agent: "node") receive `res.json()` response
- Other clients continue to receive chunked transfer encoding
- Tools are included in initialize response to avoid separate tools/list calls
